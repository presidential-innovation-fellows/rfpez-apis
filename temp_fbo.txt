<DESC>Consolidate APO, Telepost, BMC Post & BX in Bldg.211, Project No. WWCX 10-1022

The scope of the Consolidate APO, Telepost, BMC Post & BX in Bldg.211 (Project No. WWCX 10-1022) requires the contractor to furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to renovate 17,700 square Feet (SF) of building on Thule Air Base (AB), Greenland. The building at Thule AB was constructed in 1952-53.  In 1962, the building was repaired and the installations were upgraded.  The building does not currently meet life safety code. Installations are old and worn and part of the installations contains asbestos. The building is poorly isolated. Operational and energy efficiency is low and appearance is lacking.  

The work includes but is not limited to:
1.	Completely renovate/upgrade building #211.
2.	Insulation on inside of outside walls.
3.	Adding 2” exterior sidings for additional insulation.
4.	Completely replace interiors (Wall covers, Ceiling and floors).
5.	One Arctic and two cargo entrances.
6.	Key Card lock system, HVAC system and PA system.

The awardee will be responsible for obtaining the necessary shipping and use permits for explosives, etc. required to perform the work. The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October. Additionally, Thule Air Base's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift. Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally. The project magnitude is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The performance period for this project shall be approximately 1 year from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP). ”Notice to Offerors: Funds are not presently available for this effort.

Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted. This solicitation and award is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(4) and FAR 6.302-4 International Agreement, to Danish and Greenlandic firms except when procurement from such sources is not feasible.

<DESC><strong>This Pre-Solicitation Notice is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.<br /></strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) intends to issue a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotations (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Gauze Roll Dressings <strong>on or about May 2012</strong>, but the actual issue date for this RFIAQ may be delayed up to forty-five (45) business days.<br /><br />The primary objective of this effort is to standardize the quality of care across the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and operational assemblages based on the critical balance of clinical efficacy and value. The intent for this initiative is the standardization of a clinically preferred product(s) and source for institutional and operational medicine requirements at the lowest price. It is also intended for this initiative to result in the reduction of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and National Stock Numbers (NSN). As an enterprise-wide clinically driven program, vendors and products must meet specific technical requirements, plus products must meet or exceed specific clinical performance expectations as a primary consideration. Among vendors who meet the technical requirements and the products that meet or exceed the clinical acceptability, then clinically preferred, best value will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this Standardization Action (SA) will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. <br /><br />Examples of items being solicited could include, but are not limited to, latex-free/safe, Sterile Crinkle Gauze roll dressings, standard-6 ply, in approximately 2-3" &amp; 3.5-4.5" widths, and Non-Sterile Crinkle Gauze roll dressings, standard-6 ply in 4.5" widths. The estimated value of the resultant Incentive Agreement (IA) will be approximately $896,180.38 annually. <br /><br />NOTE: This initiative will be part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program which is executed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel and standardized products must be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program. To participate in this Standardization Action (SA) your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Med-Surg PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor, or be in the process of obtaining a DAPA and a separate commercial agreement with Cardinal Health and Owens &amp; Minor. This requirement is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization initiative and agree to allow PVs to distribute their products. The IA resulting from the solicitation is a supplement to the PV Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. Vendor must update their DAPA numbers for this product line in the DAPA Management System with the country from which each line item is an end product, IAW the Trade Agreements Act. Vendors responding to the solicitation will be required to ensure that all DAPA line items/end products in the subject product line list the proper Trade Agreements Act country.<br /><br />Detailed information about the requirements and selection process will be provided in the RFIAQ. The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the RFIAQ is imminent. Upon issuance of the RFIAQ, all solicitation information will be available electronically on the Federal Business Opportunities website. <br />

<DESC>NASA/JSC plans to extend the period of performance with United Space Alliance, LLC(USA) to provide Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of assigned Space Shuttle Program (SSP)Ground Systems and Ground Operations Capabilities and Special Studies associated withexisting ground operation capabilities at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC).   USA currentlyprovides these services under an existing Justification for Other than Full and OpenCompetition (JOFOC) on the Space Program Operations Contract, NNJ06VA01C.  The intent andcoverage of this JOFOC is to allow KSC customers and/or NASA programs of record to obtainservices during this gap period until full implementation of the Test and OperationsSupport Contract (TOSC) is in place to support these requirements. The TOSC request forproposal contains the requirements necessary to support the O&M of assigned SSP groundsystems and ground operations.	When the original JOFOC was approved, the start date ofthe TOSC was anticipated to be no later than October 1, 2012.  However, now the startdate is anticipated to be in January 2013.  This extension is imperative in order tomaintain and sustain the critical Ground Support Equipment, Facilities, andinfrastructure at KSC.	The services that will be performed during this gap periodinclude:1. The Contractor shall continue to perform O&M on a limited number of Space ProgramOperations Contract (SPOC) baselined SSP ground systems as assigned by the Government toensure system viability and operational expertise remains available during the transitionperiod and before the new Test and Operations Support Contract (TOSC) is awarded. Theassigned SSP ground systems may include, but is not limited to: Ground Support Equipment(GSE) in the SSP Launch Processing Areas, such as: Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB),Launch Complex 39 Pads A & B, Mobile Launch Platforms (MLPs)/Mobile Launcher (ML),Rotation Processing & Storage Facility (RPSF), Assembly & Refurbishment Facility (ARF),and Launch Control Center (LCC). It will also include Fixed Cranes, Powered Doors, andStructures in SSP Launch Processing Facilities (i.e. - VAB, Pads, MLPs/ML, RPSF, ARF) andTransporters (i.e. - Crawler-Transporters). The O&M of GSE systems includes making theunique systems and capabilities available to future programs for manufacturing, i.e.,utilizing the Thermal Protection System Facility (TPSF) to manufacture thermal protectionsystems test articles and/or production runs until transfer to TOSC.2. The Contractor shall provide ground operations capabilities support and specialstudies for human spaceflight ground and launch operations which includes transfer ofunique ground operations experience from the shuttle program, such as flighthardware/systems and maintenance of ground systems (GSE and Infrastructure), which can beused to enhance future spacecraft and launch vehicles.	Special study activities mayinclude support to NASA for the development, modeling simulation and analysis of itemssuch as concept of operations; design for operability; processing strategies; andreliability, maintainability, and supportability. The Contractor shall provide theirground operations expertise in support of NASA-led design and concept reviews of humanspaceflight ground systems and flight elements.The delay in the award and full implementation of the TOSC has put NASA in a positionwhere there will be no contract in place to support ground systems and ground operationscapabilities at KSC after September 30, 2012.  USA is uniquely positioned to provide therequired services as they will be on-site at KSC performing program and contracttransition and retirement/closeout activities through September 30, 2013. In addition,USA has the unique knowledge, skills and expertise of human space flight and associatedfunctions based on their 15+ years of experience. USA is uniquely qualified due to theirfamiliarity with KSC ground systems, processes, and infrastructure involved in humanspaceflight operations. This expertise would be difficult to obtain from anothercontractor not only because of the time and cost associated with the certification andtraining of employees, but also in replicating the expertise that currently resideswithin USAs workforce. QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS SYNOPSIS SHOULD BE DIRECTED IN WRITING TO:KARI.R.CEZAT@NASA.GOV. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item usingFAR Part 12. See Notes 22 and 26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilitiesand qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contactnot later than 4:30 p.m. EST on March 19, 2012.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.
<p>THE TECHNOLOGY: A multi-scale processing method for producing tellurium (Te)-containing nanostructures with selected diameter and size dimensions. The present invention provides a wide variety of tellurium-containing structures of a macro-, micro-, or nano-scale size in a single process not previously known. This is possible via control of pressure, the initial mass of material, and the temperature gradient inside the reaction vessel. For example, conducting the reaction at a temperature of 85 C affords structures with diameters 57&plusmn; 5 nm while a temperature of 115 C and provides diameters of 374 &plusmn; 11 nm. The process is a cheaper alternative to known methods that require high pressure reactions (hydrothermal), or solvent-based reaction (solvo-thermal) conditions.</p>
<p>Patent pending.</p>
<p>For all inquiries, please reference Battelle IPID 30061</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT. Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than thirty (30) days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity. Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology. Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement. Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations. Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice, referencing Battelle IPID 30061.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE for market research purposes.
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Material Measurement Laboratory's Measurement Services Division (MSD) provides customers with the means to obtain Standard Reference Materials (SRMs), Calibration Services, and Standard Reference Data. NIST supports accurate and compatible measurements by certifying and providing over 1,300 of the highest quality and metrological value Standard Reference Materials to industry, academia, and Government. These materials are used to perform instrument calibrations in units as part of overall quality assurance programs, to verify the accuracy of specific measurements and to support the development of new measurements.</p>
<p>In order to manage a dynamic, information-heavy website which also has e-commerce functionality and interfaces with an extensive SRM inventory and shipping software, MSD has a need for a Contractor to customize, enhance and expand the SRM Order Request System (ORS). The SRM ORS application is essential to the MSD mission and is heavily used by outside institutions.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be required to perform tasks such as security related tasks which include modifications, enhancements or fixes to the SRM ORS system. The contractor must protect personally identifiable (PII) and business identifiable (BII) information. Designing, testing and installing website modifications to the existing website shall also be required</p>
<p>Over the years the SRM ORS has required mandated security enhancements which had to be implemented. Some of these are: implementation of Cold Fusion Encrypt with FIPS140 encryption standards throughout the site; adding the warning banner to the SRM Admin., adding the LDAP authentication to the SRM Admin, having the system shut down after 3 failed log in attempts; having the system time out after 20 minutes and forcing external customers to adhere to the NIST 12 character password policy.<br /><br />The software code was written by Atlas Blue Interactive LLC. Currently, Atlas Blue maintains a development version of the entire site which is always in synch with the production site. This is in addition to NIST's internal development environment. Atlas Blue has been identified as the vendor to perform the work as they have experience with the current ORS system and currently maintain this system under another Federal contract.<br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses with the experience to perform the work required and that previous experience working with Government agencies on critical websites. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 541511, with a size standard of $25.0M or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice. If two or more small businesses are identified, we will consider a set-aside.</p>
<p>Companies that have the capability to perform security enhancements, website enhancements, meeting the above requirements, are requested to email information to andrea.parekh@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice.</p>
<p>The letter shall include any information relevant to your capabilities. Also, the following information is requested as part of the response to this sources sought notice:<br />1. Name and size of the company that will be performing the work.<br />2. Indication of the number of days after the receipt of the order that is typical for delivery of such tool.<br />3.

<p>U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission<br />Division of Contracts <br />Attn: Jennifer A. DeFino; M/S: TWB-01-B10M<br />11555 Rockville Pike<br />Rockville, MD 20852</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this procurement is 541690- Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. The period of performance will be 48 months.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background<br /></span></strong>The NRC is responsible for the licensing and regulatory oversight of civilian nuclear power reactors in the United States. The NRC implements regulations and develops and implements policies, programs, and procedures pertaining to all aspects of licensing and inspection of these facilities.</p>
<p>The NRC Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) is responsible for ensuring the public health and safety through licensing and inspection activities at all commercial nuclear power reactor facilities in the United States. Evaluation of license renewal applications (LRAs) for an additional 20 years of operations is performed by the Division of License Renewal (DLR). DLR performs its work in accordance with the requirements of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 54 (10 CFR Part 54), "Requirements for Renewal of Operating Licenses for Nuclear Power Plants." In addition, DLR uses guidance provided in NUREG-1800, "Standard Review Plan for Review of License Renewal Applications for Nuclear Power Plants," Revision 2 (SRP-LR), dated December 2010, and NUREG-1801, "Generic Aging Lessons Learned (GALL) Report," Revision 2, also dated December 2010.</p>
<p>The provisions of 10 CFR Part 54 do not preclude subsequent license renewals beyond the initial renewal. Of the 104 commercial nuclear power plant reactors, 71 have already received their renewed license and 15 additional units are in review now. The NRC is now preparing for a subsequent license renewal period (i.e., 60 to 80 years of operation), possibly as early as 2015. These activities will include identifying the issues that need to be resolved to ensure safe operation for up to 80 years, conducting research to resolve these and potential new issues, and developing guidance to nuclear power plants in programs to manage the aging of systems, structures, and components important to safety. In particular, the two NUREGs mentioned above will be revised to provide guidance to support subsequent license renewal.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capability Sought<br /></span></strong>The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing technical assistance in renewing documents and research results to identify issues that need to be resolved for subsequent license renewal and assisting in developing input for NRC guidance for subsequent license renewal.<br />Specific activities include providing technical assistance to the NRC that includes: <br />1) Reviewing technical reports prepared by the NRC Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, NRC reports providing guidance developed since the last publication of the GALL Report, reports on domestic and international nuclear power plant operating experience, and research reports from industry organizations, Electric Power Research Institute, and the Department of Energy; <br />2) Identifying issues that require resolution for the safe long-term operation of nuclear power plants; and<br />3) Drafting input to guidance for managing the aging of nuclear power plant structures, systems and components for those issues that have been resolved. <br />NRR requires contractor support to augment the available staff resources and provide access to experts with competencies, accrued knowledge, and highly specialized skills in the areas of, but not limited to: nuclear engineering, materials engineering, corrosion engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and civil engineering. NRR requires qualified technical specialists with extensive expertise in the technical areas described.</p>

<SUBJECT>RFI for Carbamate Insecticides for Indoor Residual Spraying in Ethiopia
<SOLNBR>RFI6631200001
<RESPDATE>031212
<CONTACT>Sam G. Nagwere, Senior A&A Specialist, Phone 251-111-306002, Email snagwere@usaid.gov - Gregory E. Taitt, Supervisory Contracting Officer, Phone 251-111-306002, Email gtaitt@usaid.gov
<DESC><br />CARBAMATE INSECTICIDES FOR INDOOR RESIDUAL SPRAYING (IRS) IN ETHIOPIA<br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION NUMBER RFI-663-12-00001<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. The United States Agency for International Development in Ethiopia (USAID/Ethiopia), is seeking information from the market to identify potential offerors with demonstrated capability to fulfill the agency's requirement. This is not a request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract. <br />Under the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI), USAID/Ethiopia has plans for award of a new contract in an amount of $3 to $4 million for purchase between 120kg to 150 of insecticide for indoor residual spraying of household activities and packed in 250g/pack. Since 2007, the U.S. Government has supported malaria prevention and control activities in Ethiopia through PMI [http://www.pmi.gov]. IRS represents one of the main prevention and control activities supported by PMI. For the 2012 IRS activities, USAID/Ethiopia has planned to procure one or more of WHOPES approved carbamate class insecticides for indoor residual insecticide spray activities namely: propoxur or bendiocarb. This is to support specifically IRS activities in Oromia Regional State of Ethiopia. The insecticide is required to be in country ready for use by June 30, 2012. However, USAID/Ethiopia is experiencing unforeseen delays in commencing the procurement process which may lead to imposition of restrictive lead times for acquiring the insecticides. If a decision to proceed with the procurement is made, currently USAID/Ethiopia anticipates awarding the contract by April 30, 2012. This RFI is being issued to determine whether or not there are qualified sources that will be able to meet this requirement (i.e. product availability and supply with very short delivery schedules).<br />The information obtained from this RFI will be utilized as market research for consideration in development of the acquisition plan for this requirement, which may eventually result in a Government contractual action.<br />Interested parties are invited to submit a capability statement along with their company profile to include:<br />1) Information demonstrating that their company has the capability to successfully delivery this project. The offeror should be familiar with this type of work and should have done it before.<br />2) Type of carbamate insecticide and formulation that the offeror can supply<br />3) Least lead time the offeror requires to deliver the insecticide to Ethiopia.<br />4) Company name, company mail address, point of contact, telephone number, e-mail address, DUNS number.<br />5) Information indicating similar contracts your firm has successfully completed as a prime contractor. The government is looking for Prime Contractor experience only.<br />6) Provide information of your firm's ability to execute projects in geographical, political, cultural and political context similar to Ethiopia. <br />The capability statement should not exceed 5 pages and should be submitted as e-mail attachment to Snagwere@usaid.gov with a copy to Gtaitt@usaid.gov not later than March 12, 2012. No telephonic submissions will be honored.<br />This RFI is a market research tool only, and IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. No Solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of a solicitation. Responses to this RFI notice will be treated as information only; they do not constitute offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. RFI responses will not be returned; neither will Respondents be notified of the Government's consideration of the information received. Respondents are advised that USAID is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is being issued as a follow-on to the AVCATT R/A Concurrency Upgrade Request for Information (RFI) dated 3 February 2012.  Since the posting of the RFI, the Government has updated the technical documentation of this requirement and is hereby providing Industry with an opportunity to amend their responses to the RFI, accordingly.  Additionally, this SSN provides Industry with the opportunity to respond to the requirements, should those parties interested have missed the RFI closing date.  The updated R/A Concurrency Upgrade technical documentation includes the following:<br>-	Statement of Work (SOW) for the overall planned Indefinite Delivery Indefinite    Quantity (ID/IQ) effort;<br>-	SOW for the Apache Longbow Block II Lot 13.1 and Munitions Upgrade (first planned Delivery Order);<br>-	Technical Specification for the AH-64D BLK II Lot 13.1 and Munitions;<br>-	Fidelity Analysis for the AH-64D Lot 13.1.<br><br>Market research is being conducted to determine interested sources and technology capabilities of contractors for the procurement of the AVCATT R/A Concurrency Upgrade.  Interested sources are invited to provide a capability statement to upgrade and deliver the Apache Block 2 Lot 13.1 capability as described in the attached technical documentation. <br><br>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  AVCATT is a virtual simulation training system.  In a stand-alone configuration or networked with multiple virtual and constructive simulation systems, (e.g., Close Combat Tactical Trainer- CCTT, Virtual Battlespace 2- VBS2, Call for Fire Trainer- (CFFT) it provides the capability for aviation units to train and sustain performance of the critical collective tasks that support the battlefield functional areas of maneuver, maneuver support, and maneuver sustainment and their associated Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) of intelligence, Fire Support (FS), air defense, mobility/counter mobility/survivability, combat service support, and command and control.<br><br>PEO STRI Product Manager for Air and Command Tactical Trainers (PM ACTT), Assistant Product Manager (APM) AVCATT has a requirement for maintaining concurrency for the Recon and Attack components of the AVCATT system.   This includes upgrading the current Apache (AH-64D) Block II Lot 10 to AH-64D Block II Lot 13.1 as the base effort.  <br><br>Options for future efforts may include the following:<br><br>1.	Apache AH-64D Block III Capability<br>2.	Kiowa OH-58D & OH-58F Capabilities<br>3.	Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) integration into AVCATT <br><br>INDUSTRY DAY:  An AVCATT R/A Concurrency Upgrade Industry Day event, sponsored by PM ACTT, will be held on 7 March 2012 from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM EST.  The purpose of this Industry Day event is to present a Government overview of the AVCATT R/A Concurrency Upgrade requirements, as well as provide contractors the opportunity to view an AVCATT suite.  The Industry Day event will be conducted at:<br><br>Hunter Army Air Field<br>187 Markwell Street<br>Building 1292 Classroom 26<br>Savannah, GA 31409<br><br>The briefing of the AVCATT and the forthcoming requirements for the R/A Concurrency Upgrade will begin at 8:00AM EST on 7 March 2012.  Those contractors wishing to attend the AVCATT R/A Concurrency Upgrade Industry Day, please send your intentions to attend and the number of personnel that will be attending to Lauren.Bushika@us.army.mil, with a copy to Cindi.Slepow@us.army.mil on or before 5 March 2012; this is to facilitate the Government's planning for seating at the event.  Attached for reference are two documents pertaining to Industry Day; the AVCATT R/A Industry Day Company Information, as well as the AVCATT R/A Question Form.  Please note, this event is open to U.S. Government contractors, only.  Furthermore, the Industry Day slides as well as all questions and answers captured during the Industry Day event will be published by COB, Friday 9 March 2012.<br><br>ACQUISITION APPROACH:  The Government is currently developing an acquisition strategy for the AVCATT R/A Concurrency Upgrade.  It is anticipated that the requirements will be fulfilled via delivery orders under a single source IDIQ contract in accordance with FAR Part 16.  The Government anticipates award on a Best Value/Trade-off basis.  The contract type for this effort has not yet been determined.  Interested parties are requested to review the requirements and information stated above and to submit a written response by the closing date of this posting.   The industry feedback received will allow PEO STRI to validate cost and schedule projections and allocate funds to satisfy this requirement.  Please note, this is effort is being issued as a follow-on to the existing AVCATT contract, however, the Government feels that this effort can be competitively bid as this requirement has been adequately scoped and sufficient data can be provided to the Contractor in order to satisfactorily propose.  Issues to be considered in the acquisition strategy for this effort include the following:<br><br> 	The AVCATT program has various pieces of software that are proprietary these are listed in the supplemental data.  Successful bidders will need to provide details on how their solution will address these. <br><br> 	The AVCATT program has identified the quantities for the base effort to include the entire AVCATT fleet of 144 manned modules. <br><br> 	The Government's belief (based on previous efforts conducted over the past years of the program) is that the AVCATT upgrade capabilities are better satisfied and accomplished under one contractual vehicle.  The complexity of the System architecture and the correlation of the platforms with one another cannot be split amongst Contractors. <br><br> 	A multi-platform collective environment is the primary purpose of the AVCATT and it must be the responsibility of one Contractor alone.  Cost increases as the Government is required to fund multiple Contractors to work on the different platforms while funding the integration of the separately developed platforms. <br>QUANTITIES: 	<br><br>        AH-64D Block II Lot 13.1- hardware and software, 144 manned modules<br>	AH-64D Block III- software only<br>	OH-58D- software only<br>	OH-58F- hardware and software, 102 manned modules<br>	Weapons- software only<br>	UAS- software only<br><br>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE: Ceiling of approximately $48.1M.<br> <br>RESPONSES REQUESTED:  This SSN is being issued as an update to the AVCATT R/A RFI issued on 3 February 2012.  Contractors who have previously responded and feel that, after reviewing the updated information, have adequately addressed the requirement, do not need to re-respond to this SSN.  Contractors who would like to amend their response may do so, with change pages.  The Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO) requests that those Contractors desiring the Government consider them for this opportunity respond via email only on or before 12 March 2012, no later than 12:00PM EST to Lauren.Bushika@us.army.mil, with a copy to Cindi.Slepow@us.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:  Vandium Sample Cans

<CONTACT>Paula Wilkison, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-975-8448, Email paula.wilkison@nist.gov - Patrick Staines, Contracting Officer, Phone (301)975-6335, Email patrick.staines@nist.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Metal Technology of Albany, Oregon, for the purchase of vanadium sample cans under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 13.106(1)(b).
<p><br />The NIST Center for Neutron Research has a requirement for additional vanadium sample cans to be used in neutron scattering powder diffraction experiments.</p>
<p>Metal Technology is the only contractor who can provide the vanadium deep drawn tubes and has the ability to electro-weld to titanium required by the design of the required sample cans. The design of the required sample cans makes explicit use of the deep drawn character of the tubes because the smooth closed end enables making the maximum use of the available sample without increasing unwanted background scattering. This characteristic is critical to NIST's use because neutron scattering samples are typically small but expensive or time-intensive to produce. The vanadium tubes are electro-welded to titanium flanges and are required to be helium leak-tight to a tight tolerance. This tight leak tolerance is crucial as they will contain a potentially radioactive powder.</p>
<p>Metal Technology is the only contractor with both the capability to produce the deep drawn vanadium tubes plus the experience and capability to electro-weld to titanium in order to produce the reliability required in order to meet NIST's requirements. Therefore, Metal Technology is uniquely qualified to provide the required vanadium sample cans.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 331491, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 12:00 p.m. (EST) on March 16, 2012. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

Past rental from 2007 season has been sold to park employees and is not an option.  The park has rented this house prior to 2007 (under different ownership) and from 2008 through 2010.  
EFFORTS TO LOCATE OTHER SOURCESAlaska's Homestead Inn has provided these facilities for several previous seasons. A thorough internet search was conducted for additional sources. Searching real estate sites, VRBO sites, and hotel searches did not produce any additional capable sources. All actions have been taken by the Government to remove or overcome barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for required supplies or services.

<a href="mailto:paula.somers@navy.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) - Potable Water Distribution SystemsSubmissions are due nlt noon (EST) on March 30, 2012The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SPAWARSYSCEN) Atlantic, AdvancedTechnology Branch (Code 52130) is seeking information on commercially-availablepotable water distribution systems.  Water distribution systems are mobilesystems and equipment used for the transport and distribution of potable ornonpotable water.  Examples include pumping systems, piping, and storagecontainers with spigots or other facilities for filling personal containers.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Authorized Equipment List (AEL) itemnumber for this equipment is 19GN-00-H2OD: System, Water Distribution.  Theprimary focus of this request is on water distribution systems used where cleanwater is not available (e.g., dispensers, storage tanks, and transporttrailers).  The target audience for this information is emergency managementagencies, public health departments, and public utilities.  All submittalsshould be suited to their specific needs.Review of this information is being performed for the DHS System Assessment andValidation for Emergency Responders (SAVER) Program, which aims to conductobjective comparative assessments and validation of commercial equipment andsystems and provide those results with the emergency responder community.  Formore information on the SAVER Program, visit https://www.rkb.us/saver.All information received will be treated as public knowledge and may be used inSAVER Program documentation; therefore, vendors should not submit proprietaryinformation in response to this RFI.SPECIFIC INFORMATION SOUGHT INCLUDES:1. Company information, including name, address, URL, revenue, and number ofemployees.   2. Whether the company is a manufacturer or distributor.   3. Apoint of contact for follow-up information, and the point of contacts phonenumber and e-mail address.     4. Product name and a brief description (75words or less) of each water distribution system.     5. Cost information suchas purchase price and General Services Administration (GSA) scheduleinformation.The submitted information will be evaluated for inclusion in SAVER projects.If a SAVER project on this type of equipment is executed, the equipmentselection will be based upon a number of factors, including responder surveysand focus group inputs.  Consequently, follow-up requests for feedback shouldnot be made through Federal Business Opportunities posting agency.  Vendors maybe contacted following submission for more detailed product information.Vendor provided information may be reformatted for publication in SAVER Programdocuments.SUBMITTALSRespondents are required to complete the attached product summary questionnaire(Potable Water Distribution Systems_RFI_pub.pdf) for each product and submitthe questionnaires FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS ON THE FIRST PAGE OF THEQUESTIONNAIRE.The technical point of contact is Darius Tavasoli at darius.tavasoli@navy.milor Brian Spell at brian.r.spell@navy.mil.The information received shall be reviewed to conduct objective, comparativeassessments and validation of available equipment and/or systems. A NOTEREGARDING THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  This RFI is for information gatheringand planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request forProposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer.

VA acquisition leadership will address specific issues and concerns expressed by the Supplier community.

General Supplier concerns include:

(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)

(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers—Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:
52.212-2 Addendum:
	Evaluation Criteria.  This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors’ past 	performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations.  An 	award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.  By submission of 	an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, 	representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation 	factors.  All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability.  Failure to meet a requirement may 	result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable.  Moreover, the government reserves the right 	to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for 	the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors 	considered, as discussed herein, even if the 	company has not submitted an offer.  Award will be made to 	the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an 	integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as 	follows:
		(a)  FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL.  Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will 			evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis.  A decision on the technical acceptability of 			each Offeror’s technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer.  Only those offers 			determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be 			considered for an award.  The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:
		
		Subfactor 1 – Provider Capability 
1a. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.

Subfactor 2 – Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.
This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror’s ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.

Subfactor 3 – Enhanced 911 Service.  This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:
[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.
[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line 	Identification 911 database.
[c] A description of alternating routes of 911


(b)  FACTOR 2 -- PRICE.  All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price.  The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price.  The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.  

(c)  FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE.  In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including:  reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources.  Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated.  When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements.  The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror’s ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation.  The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows:  
			(A)  Substantial Confidence – Based on the Offeror’s performance record, the 					Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the 				required effort.
			(B)Satisfactory Confidence –Based on the Offeror’s performance record, the 					Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required 				effort. 
			(C) Limited Confidence –Based on the Offeror’s performance record, the Government 				has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  
	(D) No Confidence –Based on the Offeror’s performance record, the Government has no 	expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. 
			(E) Unknown Confidence –No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror’s 				performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably 				assigned.  In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for 				whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated 			favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).
The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of “Satisfactory Confidence” or lower.  If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a “Substantial Confidence” 	performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to 	the Government.  If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.

	(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications 	services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental 	body.
	(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering 	telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.

This may 	include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting 	provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet 	Government requirements. 
	(5)  "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to 	meet the Governments telecommunications needs.  The term includes the telecommunications 	facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.

	(i) Upon request, a copy of the Contractor's current existing tariffs (including changes);
	(ii)  Before filing any application to a Federal, State, or any other regulatory agency for 	new or changes to applicable rates, charges, services, or regulations relating to any CSA or 	any of the facilities or services to be furnished solely or primarily to the Government; and
	(iii) Upon request, a copy of all information, material, and data developed or prepared in 	support of or in connection with an application under paragraph ii above.
	(2) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any application that anyone other than 	the Contractor files with a governmental regulatory body, which affects or will affect the rate or 	conditions of services under this contract. These requirements also apply to applications pending 	on the effective date of this contract.
	(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization.   All Offerors shall be local exchange 	carriers certificated  (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate 	of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided.  This 	contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction 	over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its 	jurisdiction.
	(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. 
	(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance 	with—
(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;
(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and
(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;
(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor’s cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS.  If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements.  The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.  If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. 
	(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.
	(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory 	beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in 	arrears.
	(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this 	contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this 	contract at any time. The Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and 	facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.
	(v) Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal. Examples are 	overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional 	costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay expediting 	charges only when—
(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or
(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.
	(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, 	fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may—
(A) Provide the equipment; or
(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.
	(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.  The Government and the Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.
	(w) Continuity of Services and Option to Extend Telecommunication Services.  
	(1)  This Communications Service Authorization (CSA) authorizes continuation of services 	previously authorized on CSA#FA8773-08-C-0035.  
	(2)  For all services required on this contract, the contractor shall continue to provide services until 	a release date is established by the government as a result of competition (cutover complete) or 	termination (including termination for cause or government convenience).  
	(3)  The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at 	the rates specified in the contract until cutover is complete. These rates will remain firm fixed 	price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension 	of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months.

	(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a 	successor; and
	(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.
	(x)  Work Orders.  Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor 	through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form).

<p>Companies protesting this procurement may file a protest 1) with the Contracting Officer, 2) with the General Accounting Office, or 3) pursuant to Executive Order No. 12979, with the Agency for a decision by the Activity's Chief of the Contracting Office. Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of Provision)</p>

The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1).

<p>If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below.

<p>REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE - All items with 21 days after date of contract award.</p>
<p>Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.

The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date; the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.</p>

<p>(b) The permissible variation shall be limited to:</p>
<p>10 Percent increase<br />10 Percent decrease</p>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />a. Experience<br />b. Understanding of the Requirement<br />ii) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation. <br />Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 5 of the SOW. . The government must receive enough information in a proposal to make a determination that the Offeror can complete the defined work or the proposal may be considered non-responsive. <br /><br />PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I. TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II. PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:<br />Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price". However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Vendors who are exempt from the Service Contract Act must certify that the exemption applies using FAR 52.222-41, 52.222-48, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</p>

<p>Addenda to 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>i) Technical Capabilities<br />a. Experience<br />b. Understanding of the Requirement<br />ii) Price</p>
<p>Technical Capabilities and its sub factors, are significantly more important than price. However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, price becomes significantly more important in the award decision.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The Government will award a single Firm Fixed Price contract from this combined synopsis/solicitation.&nbsp; Offerors are cautioned that an award may not necessarily be made to the lowest price offered. The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior services than with making an award at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall price to the Government to achieve slightly superior services. To receive consideration for award, a rating of no less than "Acceptable" must be achieved for Factor I, (Technical Capabilities). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 5 of the SOW. . The government must receive enough information in a proposal to make a determination that the Offeror can complete the defined work or the proposal may be considered non-responsive.</p>
<p>PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I - TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II - PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all CLIN prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:<br />Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price". However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Vendors who are exempt from the Service Contract Act must certify that the exemption applies using FAR 52.222-41, 52.222-48, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment Certification.</p>

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES- The proposal will be evaluated to determine whether the Offeror's methods and approach have adequately and completely considered, defined, and satisfied the requirements specified in the solicitation and whether the Offeror's methods and approach to meeting the solicitation requirements provide the Government with a high level of confidence of successful completion within the required schedule. No pricing information is to be provided in the Technical Proposal. The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal that demonstrates its understanding of the work described in Part 2.0 of the SOW. The government must receive enough information in a proposal to make a determination that the Offeror can complete the defined work or the proposal may be considered non-responsive. <br /><br />PRICE- The Offeror shall provide a document outlining their pricing using the contract line items listed above. Pricing must be provided separately from your technical proposal.</p>
<p>EVALUATION SUMMARY</p>
<p>FACTOR I. TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES-The Offeror shall submit a proposal that acknowledges the tasks identified in the Statement of Work to allow the Government to make a sufficient determination that the Offeror is capable of performing the work. <br />Sub factor a. EXPERIENCE-The Offeror shall provide a synopsis of their experience in performing the tasks listed in the Statement of Work.<br />Sub factor b. UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENT- The Government will evaluate the Offeror's understanding of the work to be performed in accordance with the SOW. The Offeror shall submit a proposal acknowledging that they are capable of completing the tasks identified in the Statement of Work, outlining their method and approach to completing the requirements.</p>
<p>FACTOR II. PRICE - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total of all contract line item prices, including all options to ensure that pricing is not unbalanced. Price will be evaluated for completeness and reasonableness using the techniques in FAR 15.404-1(b) (2). Price will become significantly more important as technical ratings approach equality. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Price.&nbsp; Proposal pricing should be presented as the contract line items are listed in this posting.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. Proposals will be adjectivally rated against each of the evaluation factors set forth in this plan and in the solicitation. Adjectival ratings for Factor I, Technical Capabilities follows. No adjectival ratings will be used to evaluate Factor II, Price.</p>
<p>Adjectival Ratings. The following adjectival ratings will be used:<br />Factor I- Technical Capabilities, will be rated using the following Adjectival Scale:<br />Outstanding-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with extensive detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a thorough understanding of the problems and offers numerous significant strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Good-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with adequate detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows an understanding of the problems and offers some significant strengths or numerous minor strengths, which are not offset by weaknesses, with an overall low to moderate degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Acceptable-A proposal that satisfies all of the Government's requirements with minimal detail to indicate feasibility of the approach and shows a minimal understanding of the problems, with an overall moderate to high degree of risk in meeting the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>Unacceptable-A proposal that contains a major error(s), omission(s) or deficiency(ies) that indicates a lack of understanding of the problems or an approach that cannot be expected to meet requirements or involves a very high risk; and none of these conditions can be corrected without a major rewrite or revision of the proposal.</p>
<p>Non-Price Factors: The importance of the Non-Price Evaluation Factors is in the following descending order with the most important factor listed first: <br />Factor I, Technical Capabilities and its sub factors combined are significantly more important than Factor II "Price". However, as Offeror's ratings for the non-price factors approach equality, Factor II "Price" becomes significantly more important in the award decision.</p>
<p>Quotes must be received by Mindy Smith, Contract Specialist, no later than 3:00 PM (EST) on March 14, 2012. Quotes will be accepted by fax at (304) 256-3332 or e-mail at smith.mindy@dol.gov.

Over and above work outside the direction of the AFTO that is found during performance will be handled on a case-by-case basis. High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the repair directive will not be considered as "over-and-above". In the event of exclusions or over-and-above work, the contractor will be required to submit an equipment condition report to the Contracting Officer detailing the finding and a listing of the additional parts and labor necessary to return the equipment to serviceable condition. Non-re-workable items replaced during modification/overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Commandant (CG-931)<br />U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters<br />Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />1900 Half Street., SW, JR11-0203 <br />Washington, DC 20593-0001 <br />Telephone 202.372.3692<br />Fax: 202.475-3904</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC>1.0 GENERAL
<p>1.1 SCOPE</p>
<p>The National Strike Force (NSF) requires contract support services to provide incident response safety training. The Contractor will provide a bid for one (1) year and four (4) optional years.</p>
<p>1.2 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan, more commonly called the National Contingency Plan (NCP), is the federal government's blueprint for responding to both oil spills and hazardous substance releases. The NCP is the result of our country's efforts to develop a national response capability and promote overall coordination among the hierarchy of responders and contingency plans. The NCP includes a framework for responding to hazardous substance spills as well as oil discharges, in addition to releases at hazardous waste sites requiring emergency removal actions.</p>
<p>Within the NCP, the NSF Strike Teams (NSFST) are designated as Special Teams required to maintain the standing ability to support Coast Guard, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Department of Defense pre-designated Federal On-Scene Coordinators (FOSC) for any discharge or substantial threat of discharge of oil into a navigable waterway of the U.S., or a release or substantial threat of a release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant into the environment of the U.S.</p>
<p>The NSF is responsible for ensuring that each Coast Guard Strike Team member has the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities needed to safely perform the NSF missions. A critical aspect of the Strike Team's mission is to respond safely to hazardous material incidents. As part of that mission, it is crucial for Strike Team personnel to organize essential information into site-specific safety plans and understand the decision-making associated with hazardous waste operations and emergency response safety programs. This training is essential to ensure Strike Team members understand the regulatory requirements for safety and are prepared to respond to hazardous material or hazardous waste incidents as safely as possible.</p>
<p>1.3 CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS</p>

<p>1.5 PLACE OF PERFORMANCE. The primary place of performance will be at the Contractor's facility which shall include classrooms, training equipment and an operational training area as defined in section 4.0 of this task order.</p>

Over and above work outside the direction of the AFTO that is found during performance will be handled on a case-by-case basis. High cost replacement parts and/or the presence of corrosion that does not exceed the tolerances stated in the repair directive will not be considered as "over-and-above". In the event of exclusions or over-and-above work, the contractor will be required to submit an equipment condition report to the Contracting Officer detailing the finding and a listing of the additional parts and labor necessary to return the equipment to serviceable condition. Non-re-workable items replaced during modification/overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.</p>

<p>15. 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer/quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting <br />Contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<DESC><strong>This project set-aside has been ammended from a Hubzone Set-aside to a total small business set-aside effective 2 March 2012. Seed project funding still not approved. Expect solicitation release within 60 days from 2 March 2012. If funding is not approved will move to another option for competition. 60 days is an estimate and is not a firm time frame.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This project has been deferred and a solicitation should&nbsp;be prepared and posted to FBO by this office within 60 days of this date (8 Feb 2012) <br /></strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Hill AFB anticipates the formation of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a 5 year continuous ordering period for the repair, installation, and alteration of built up bituminous roofing. To include but not limited to built-up roofing systems (minimum of 20yr manufacturer warranty is mandatory), lightning protection systems (master lightning protection license required), abatement for roofing containing asbestos, metal roofing repairs, flashing, and other roofing repairs on an as needed basis.<br /><br />Davis Bacon Act will apply to this acquisition and current wage rates found on WDOL applicable to each trade will apply.<br /><br />&nbsp;This IDIQ is anticipated to be a&nbsp;total small business&nbsp;set-aside per the SBA and is expected to be solicited at the end of April/beginning of May. Anticipated ceiling amount for the 5yr IDIQ will be between $5-10M. This requirement will have a "seed" project sent out with the requirement specific statement of work (SOW) and will be posted as a request for proposals (RFP). This will require a technical volume to be submitted with the pricing and is expected to be evaluated as lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) with Past Performance. The RFP will also include the generalized IDIQ SOW for review by all interested contractors. <br /><br />This contract will be to perform built-up roofing repairs, mainly by replacement, at Hill AFB, Little Mountain Complex, and the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR), UT. Contractor shall be responsible for providing all materials, labor, management, licensing, certifications, supervision, equipment, transportation, and vehicles for each task order placed on this IDIQ. Manufacturer and National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) roof detail work shall be adhered to by the contractor. Built up roofing (BUR) manufacturer certification is a qualification to propose for this contract.<br /><br />Submittal #1 shall be executed and included with the proposal to the Air Force. Prior to proposing on the solicitation (or included in the proposal) the contractor shall provide proof that they are certified by the manufacturer. Failure to provide the required certification will result in a non-responsive proposal and will not be considered for award.<br /><br />Small business contractors will need to show the ability of completing multiple projects during "roofing season" to be considered for award. Risk assessment has flagged multiple projects as an area of concern. Capabilities statement will be asked for at the time of solicitation.<br /><br />FAR Clause 52.232-18 entitled "Availability of Funds" applies to the seed project. Site visit will be coordinated for proposing on the seed project. No date or time is currently available for this site visit (expected one week after issuing solicitation). The contractor shall also need to submit bonding capability documents that meet the aggregate and project amounts, backed by a bonding surety with an A.M. Best company rating of "A". Bonding will be required per task order and will not be a blanket bonding policy.<br /><br />All text above is subject to change once the requirement is firm and the seed project is known. This is only a brief overview of the requirement and how it will be competed. Please direct any questions or concerns to SSgt Ashton Jones or A1C Lei Yang.

<p>The 22d Contracting Squadron (22 CONS) of the 22d Air Refueling Wing announces the projected solicitation for a Resource Area Manager (will include SOW with Solicitation) at McConnell AFB, Kansas 67221.</p>
<p>Anticipated workload consists of a full range of services relating to the management of the Airman and Family Readiness Center, see statement of work for full job description upon release of solicitation package. This requirement is anticipated to receive quotes from at least two women owned small businesses, therefore it will be set-aside 100% for an&nbsp;economically disadvantaged&nbsp;woman owned small business. The NAICS code for this requirement is 541513, computer system facilities management services. The Small Business Size Standard is $25,000,000.00.</p>
<p>The Government contemplates issuing a Request for Quote with a 100% small business set-aside. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. Responses to the Request for Quote (RFQ) will be evaluated using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) evaluation factors. The Government shall issue an award to a single small business using a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), contract on or about 25 March 2012 with a period of performance from&nbsp;25 March 2012 to&nbsp;30 Septemebr 2012.&nbsp;We anticipate posting the solicitation 5 days after posting of this notice. This requirement shall be procured pursuant to the regulatory direction of FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.</p>
<p>The closing date and time for submission of offers shall be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation package, including the Standard Form 1449 and continuation pages and the Statement of Work, shall be made available only on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web Site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Requests for copies of the solicitation package, or any cumulative parts thereof, by any other means shall not be honored. Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps website for the release of the solicitation package, which should be on or about 7&nbsp;March 2012 for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package and for downloading their own copy of each associative amendment, if any.</p>
<p>All firms wishing to submit a quote subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as well as the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database or risk their otherwise-timely quote being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations. Information on CCR and ORCA registrations can be obtained at their respective web sites: http://www.ccr.gov and http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>Response to this announcement is not required. The government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. The solicitation subsequent to this announcement may be cancelled. After solicitation and prior to award the possibility exists to reject all offers when cancellation is clearly in the public interest. This announcement does not obligate the Government to pay for any bid/quote preparation costs.</p>
<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 (10 AUG 2005) the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of quotes, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Gregory Oneal, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: gregory.oneal@us.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer, 2Lt. Jason Hatcher email: jason.hatcher.1@us.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE ONLY. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the responsibility of enhancing national capabilities for decontamination and disposal as a result of terrorist events and environmental sampling and analysis of all environmentalmatrices in response to nationally significant incidents (NSI). Consequently, the USEPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of analyzing environmental sample matrices contaminated by toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), chemical warfare agents (CWAs), biological agents, and radiochemical agents as a result of acts of terrorism or an environmental emergency.  A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition. The anticipated issue date is on or about September 30, 2009 for this requirement.  A copy of this request for quote (RFQ) # RFQ-DC-09-00337 will be available at the following three Government Points of Entries (GPE): http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm, http://www.fedbid.com/, and https://www.fbo.gov/.

Consequently, the USEPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of analyzing environmental sample matrices contaminated by toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), chemical warfare agents (CWAs), biological agents, and radiochemical agents as a result of acts of terrorism or an environmental emergency. A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition. 
Potential vendors' viability will be evaluated on the following six factors: Accredited Quality System, Plans and Procedures, Sample Management System, Facilities for Sample Handling and Storage, Data Management and Exchange, and Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The ERLN review team will review these documents and calculate a score for the application based on criteria established by the EPA. This score is used to determine if the laboratory is eligible for ERLN and, as applicable, Water Laboratory Alliance (WLA) membership.

This requirement will be posted for 90 days with an anticipated closing date of December 30, 2009 at 3:00 pm EST. A copy of this request for quote (RFQ) #RFQ-DC-09-00337 including attachments will be available at the following locations: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm, and https://www.fbo.gov/.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   The purpose of this amendment to the synopsis is to change the closing date from September 24, 2010 to January 25, 2011. Please read below. All other terms and conditions remain the same.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the responsibility of enhancing national capabilities for decontamination and disposal as a result of terrorist events and environmental sampling and analysis of all environmental matrices in response to nationally significant incidents (NSI). To protect the nation from the potential threats posed by terrorism or environmental emergencies, the EPA implemented the Environmental Response Laboratory Network (ERLN). The ERLN is one of five laboratory response networks under the Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The mission of the ERLN is to provide known laboratory capabilities, capacities, and quality data in a scalable, systematic, and coordinated response to environmental emergencies providing preparedness, response, remediation and recovery analytical support. Consequently, the USEPA Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to establish Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) in accordance with FAR Part 16.703 with vendors who are capable of analyzing environmental sample matrices contaminated by toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), chemical warfare agents (CWAs), biological agents, and radiochemical agents as a result of acts of terrorism or an environmental emergency. A BOA is not a contract, as referenced in FAR Part 16.703; it is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency, contracting activity, or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the BOA. Additionally, a BOA does not imply any agreement by the government to place future contracts or orders with the contractor or to be used in any manner to restrict competition. 
Potential vendors' viability will be evaluated on the following six factors: Accredited Quality System, Plans and Procedures, Sample Management System, Facilities for Sample Handling and Storage, Data Management and Exchange, and Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN). The ERLN review team will review these documents and calculate a score for the application based on criteria established by the EPA. This score is used to determine if the laboratory is eligible for ERLN and, as applicable, Water Laboratory Alliance (WLA) membership.

This requirement will be posted for approximately  132 days with a closing date of January 25, 2010 at 3:00 pm EST. A copy of this request for quote (RFQ) # RFQ-DC-09-00337 including attachments will be available at the following locations: http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm, and https://www.fbo.gov/.

<AWDDATE>043012
<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE

The government intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
 
The Government intends to make a sole source award to CloudShield Technologies (CS) Inc., 212 Gibraltar Drive, Sunnyvale CA 94089. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541511 and the size standard is $25 million dollars. CloudShield Technologies (CS) will provide technical support and engineering to research, develop, and integrate CS Deep Packet Processing Module (DPPM) technology with current and future AF Global Information Grid (GIG) Information Operations Platform (IOP) and IOP compatible installations and upgrades for 90 Information Operation Squadron (90IOS), Lackland AFB TX.

CS DPPM technology is patented Intellectual Property (IP) and CS possesses the requisite knowledge, apparatus, and methodologies required for the AF to embark on any effort to create a portable, software-based, and VM-deployable DPPM execution environment.

All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.

All submission must be sent to the point of contact (POC) listed below and received by 16 March 2012, 1:00 P.M., Mountain Standard Time (MST). This notice is not a Request for Proposals, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. This notice is not a commitment from the Government. The Government will not reimburse any bid or proposal costs as a result of this notice.

AFSPC Ombudsman information (AFFARS 5352.201-9101)
OMBUDSMAN (APR 2010)
(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 
(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_rev2003.pdf OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). 
(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM or AFISRA ombudsmen, AFSPC/A7K, 150 Vandenberg Street, Peterson AFB CO 80914, (P) 719-554-5250, (F) 719-554-5299, mailto:A7K.wf@peterson.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU or ARISRA level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.
(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.
(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.
(End of clause)
